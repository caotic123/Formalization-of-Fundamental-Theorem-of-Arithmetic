# Formalization-of-Fundamental-Theorem-of-Arithmetic

We provided a set of definitions on arithmetics (divisibility, test for primes, products, and ...), towards Euclid's lemma and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Our goal is to provide those theorems using basic and elementary proofs.

 ~ Have fun :)
